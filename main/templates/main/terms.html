                <li>
                    You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. The Company cannot

                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of features or capacity of your account. The Company
                    does not accept any liability for such loss.

            <h2>Cancellation and Termination</h2>
            <ol>
                <!-- <li>
                    You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. An email or phone request to cancel
                    your account is not considered cancellation. You can cancel your account at any time by clicking on
                    the Settings link in your profile photo at the top of the screen. The Settings screen provides a
                    simple no-questions-asked cancellation link.

                <li>
                    All of your content will be inaccessible from the Service immediately upon cancellation. Within
                    90 days, all content will be permanently deleted from backups and logs. This information can not be
                    recovered once it has been permanently deleted.

                <li>
                    If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will take
                    effect immediately, and you will not be charged again. But there will not be any prorating of
                    unused time in the last billing cycle.

                    the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your
                    Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all content in your account. The Company reserves
                    the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

                <li>
                    The Company shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, price change,
                    suspension or discontinuance of the Service.
                </li>

                <li>
                    The Company does not pre-screen content, but reserves the right (but not the obligation) in their
                    sole discretion to refuse or remove any content that is available via the Service.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and
                resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. Continued use of the Service after any such
                changes shall constitute your consent to such changes.
